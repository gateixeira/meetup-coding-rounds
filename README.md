# Leipziger Meetup: Tech Interview Prep - Coding Rounds

This repository hosts all the code that is written during the [Tech Interview Prep - Coding Rounds](https://www.meetup.com/leipzig-leetcode-group/) Meetup that happens bi-weekly in Leipzig, Germany.

We meet to have fun and to get to know other developers. But as a by-product, we are prepared to ace a technical interview, should the situation require it.

We randomly choose one or two [Leetcode](leetcode.com) problems to solve together and discuss the approaches, see where we can improve and try to simulate what would happen in an interview process.

Come join us. It's free!
